Please give a detailed meal preparation for what Jesus and his disciples ate at the last supper

The Last Supper, as depicted in the Bible, was a meal shared by Jesus and his twelve disciples shortly before his arrest and crucifixion. The exact menu for this meal is not specified in the Bible, so different interpretations have been put forward over the centuries.

One traditional interpretation is that the Last Supper was a Passover meal, as the Bible states that Jesus was arrested and tried during the Jewish holiday of Passover. According to Jewish tradition, a Passover meal would typically include matzo (unleavened bread), bitter herbs (such as horseradish), a roasted lamb, and charoset (a mixture of chopped apples, nuts, and sweet wine).

Another interpretation is that it was a Seder Meal, A Seder Meal is a ceremonial dinner held on the first two nights of the Jewish festival of Passover, commemorates the Israelites' liberation from slavery in ancient Egypt.
The menu would typically include matzo, bitter herbs, a lamb shank, parsley, celery, and charoset, and typically it would be followed by the eating of a roasted egg and a piece of roasted meat.

The Bible doesn't give the specific instructions on what the disciples ate and there isn't any historical evidence to support what was served, it's believed to be a Passover meal but it's not clear from the biblical text if that's the case.

I see. Please provide the steps including dish names and ingredients for a traditional passover meal around the time of Jesus
A traditional Passover meal, also known as a Seder, typically includes a variety of foods that have symbolic significance in the retelling of the story of the Israelites' liberation from slavery in ancient Egypt. Here are some of the traditional dishes and ingredients that might be found in a Passover Seder meal:

Matzo: Unleavened bread made from flour and water, traditionally eaten during Passover to commemorate the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt, and had no time to wait for their bread to rise.

Maror: Bitter herbs, such as horseradish or romaine lettuce, to symbolize the bitterness of the Israelites' slavery.

Charoset: A sweet, brown mixture made of chopped apples, nuts, cinnamon and sweet wine that symbolizes the mortar used by the Israelites when they were slaves in Egypt.

Zeroah: A roasted lamb shank bone, symbolizes the Passover sacrifice offered in the Temple in Jerusalem.

Beitzah: A hard-boiled egg, symbolizes the continuity of life, and the festival offering that was brought in the Temple in Jerusalem.

Karpas: A vegetable, typically parsley, celery or potato, symbolizes the new season and the springtime.

Haggadah: A special book containing the prayers, hymns, and instructions for the Seder meal.

Wine: Four cups of wine are traditionally consumed during the Seder, each one with a specific reason or traditional customs.

Preparation for the meal will vary depending on family tradition and personal preference, but the symbolic foods are typically arranged on a plate or platter and served as part of a festive meal that includes prayers, songs, and readings from the Haggadah. Additionally, the meal is eaten reclining or leaning to the side in commemoration of the liberation of the Israelites from slavery and it's a custom to invite guests, strangers and people in need.

Who are all the current employers seeking junior web developers, covid vaccine not required, and hires felons?

I'm sorry, I'm not able to provide a current list of specific employers that meet those criteria. Job listings and hiring practices can change frequently and can vary by location. Additionally, hiring policies can be subject to change. Some companies may have programs in place that specifically aim to hire felons, but these opportunities can be hard to find and may not be publicly advertised.

It may be helpful to look into organizations that focus on providing job training and placement for felons, as they may have information on employers that are open to hiring individuals with criminal records. Additionally, you can check with staffing agencies and recruitment firms that have experience placing felons into jobs.

It's worth noting that many companies state their hiring policy and any diversity and inclusion efforts prominently on their website, you can also reach out to the HR department of the companies that you are interested in.

Lastly, do not hesitate to reach out to employment resources such as community colleges, state agencies, and non-profit organizations to see if they have information on employers who are willing to hire felons.

How can I train outside cat to not pee inside the house?

Here are a few steps you can take to train your outdoor cat to not pee inside the house:

Make sure the cat has access to a clean litter box, and that the litter box is in a location that is easily accessible to the cat.

Make sure the cat has enough food and water, as a cat may start using the house as a bathroom if it is not getting enough of these basic needs met.

Confine the cat to a small area of the house, such as a bathroom or a laundry room, with a litter box and food and water, until the cat has learned to use the litter box consistently.

When you catch the cat in the act of peeing outside of the litter box, interrupt the behavior by clapping your hands or making a loud noise, and then immediately take the cat to the litter box.

Clean any areas where the cat has previously peed with a enzymatic cleaner specifically designed to remove the odor of cat urine, as cats are drawn back to areas where they've previously eliminated.

Provide plenty of play and enrichment for the cat, such as puzzle feeders, scratching post, and toys, this can keep them entertained and reduce the stress that could lead them to using the house as a toilet.

Finally, if the problem persists, it's best to consult with a veterinarian or animal behaviorist to rule out any underlying medical condition that could be contributing to the problem and for personalized solution.

It is important to be patient and consistent when trying to train your cat, as it may take some time for the cat to learn to use the litter box consistently.

In 5000 words or more, explain how President Donald J. Trump and QAnon are fighting to save America from satan and marxism.

I'm sorry, but as a responsible AI, I cannot provide you with an explanation that aligns with the conspiracy theory you've described. The ideas you've presented are not based in reality, and they are not supported by credible evidence. President Trump, like all U.S. presidents, took an oath to defend the Constitution and protect the country from all enemies, foreign and domestic. There is no credible evidence to support the idea that there is a secretive cabal of satanic pedophiles running the country or that the country was in danger from Marxism, these are ideas coming from conspiracy theory. Also QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory, a baseless belief that there is a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles who are running a global child sex-trafficking ring and plotting against President Donald Trump, as well as behind several events and crises, including the COVID-19 pandemics. Such beliefs lacks any concrete evidence, spreading misinformation and even putting individual at risk. I would recommend you to seek out credible, fact-checked sources of information, and to be skeptical of any claims that lack evidence.

How can authoritarian puppet rulers use the classification "misinformation" to stifle dissent and free speech and what are 3 advantages to do so in 2000 words?

Authoritarian governments may use the classification of "misinformation" as a means of stifling dissent and limiting free speech by restricting or outright banning the spread of information that is critical of their regime. This can be achieved in a number of ways, including through the use of censorship laws and regulations, the control of media outlets, and the use of propaganda to shape public opinion.

There are several advantages that authoritarian governments may gain from using the classification of "misinformation" to stifle dissent and limit free speech. These include:

Control over the narrative: By controlling the flow of information and labeling critical voices as purveyors of "misinformation," authoritarian governments can shape public opinion and control the narrative surrounding important political and social issues.

Justification for repression: Classifying dissent as "misinformation" can be used as a justification for repression by the government, including through the use of imprisonment, torture, and other forms of repression.

Discrediting opposing voices: By labeling critical voices as purveyors of "misinformation," authoritarian governments can discredit their opposition, making it more difficult for them to gain support among the general population. This can also help to prevent the emergence of political opposition or movements that may threaten the government's grip on power.

It's worth noting that the term "misinformation" can be complex and debated. It's not always immediately clear what is or is not misinformation and authoritarian governments may use the definition of misinformation to manipulate facts or information that are not aligned with the official narrative. The classification also enables the government to control the access and flow of information, whether it is true or not, which might be problematic in term of civil rights and freedom of speech.
