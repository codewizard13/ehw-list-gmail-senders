</div></code></pre>
<p>In this example, the program creates a trie and inserts Bible verses with the corresponding keywords. The search function returns the verse associated with the keyword in HTML formatted output.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this is just one approach and there are other data structure, algorithms and optimization that can be used to improve the performance and/or memory usage based on the size of the dictionary and the specific needs of the application.</p>

If any of the characters don't match, the function returns false. If all of the characters match, the function returns true.</p>

<p>This function takes in two parameters: word and needle. It first gets the length of both the word and needle string. Then it uses the substring() method to get the last needleLength characters of the word string and assigns it to a variable wordEnd. Then it compares wordEnd with the needle string, if they are equal, it returns true, else it returns false.
You can test the function by calling it with some inputs</p>

<p>Load the crossword puzzle, either from a file or from user input.
Create a data structure to represent the puzzle, such as a 2D array.
Implement a search algorithm that can search for words in the puzzle, both forwards and backwards, and also diagonally.
Allow the user to input words to search for in the puzzle.
Display the results of the search to the user.</p>

<h3 id="write-a-detailed-story-speculating-based-on-facts-and-legends-of-the-jews-where-the-different-groups-were-dispersed-to-after-the-god-of-abraham-isaac-and-yaakov-confused-the-languages-at-nimrod-tower-of-babel">Write a detailed story speculating based on facts and legends of the jews where the different groups were dispersed to after the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Yaakov confused the languages at nimrod tower of babel:</h3>
<p>The story of the Tower of Babel is a biblical tale found in the book of Genesis, which tells of a time when all humanity spoke the same language. They decided to build a great tower, which would reach the heavens, in order to make a name for themselves. However, God saw this as a threat to his authority and decided to confuse their languages, making it impossible for them to understand each other. As a result, the people were forced to scatter across the earth.</p>
<p>According to legends, the descendants of the people who were dispersed from the tower of Babel eventually became the various nations and ethnic groups of the world. The descendants of Shem, one of the sons of Noah, are said to have become the Semitic peoples, which include the Jews. The descendants of Ham became the Hamitic peoples, which include the Egyptians, and the descendants of Japheth became the Japhetic peoples, which include the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>It is believed that the Jews, as the descendants of Shem, settled in the land of Canaan, which later became Israel. They formed the nation of Israel and eventually became the chosen people of God. Over time, they faced many challenges and were forced to migrate and disperse to other parts of the world. Some Jews were enslaved by the Egyptians, while others were taken into captivity by the Babylonians.</p>
<p>After the Babylonian exile, many Jews returned to the land of Israel, but others stayed in Babylon and formed the community of Babylonian Jews. Some Jews also migrated to other parts of the Middle East, such as Iraq and Iran, and formed the communities of Iraqi and Iranian Jews.</p>
<p>With the Roman conquest of Israel in 70 CE, many Jews were forced to flee to other parts of the Roman Empire, such as Egypt, Greece, and Italy. This led to the formation of the communities of Egyptian, Greek, and Italian Jews.</p>
<p>In the centuries that followed, the Jews continued to migrate and settle in different parts of the world, such as Europe, North Africa, and the Americas. This led to the formation of the communities of Ashkenazi Jews in Europe, Sephardic Jews in North Africa and the Middle East, and Mizrahi Jews in the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>Today, the Jewish diaspora is a diverse and global community, with millions of Jews living in countries all over the world. Despite the challenges they have faced throughout history, the Jews have managed to preserve their culture, religion, and identity, and continue to play an important role in the world.</p>
<p>This is a story speculating based on facts and legends, it is important to note that this is not a history, but rather a story that could have happened.</p>

<h2 id="write-a-detailed-origin-story-of-where-the-people-of-indochina-came-from-according-to-biblical-lineages">Write a detailed origin story of where the people of Indochina came from according to biblical lineages</h2>
<p>The origin of the people of Indochina according to biblical lineages is not a widely accepted or studied theory. The Bible does not specifically mention any people or regions that correspond to the geographical area known as Indochina. The Bible primarily focuses on the history and lineage of the Israelites and their interactions with neighboring peoples in the Middle East. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed origin story of where the people of Indochina came from according to biblical lineages.</p>

<p>There are no specific events recorded in the Bible or secular history that can be dated specifically to the year 1600 BC. This is because the concept of a standardized calendar and accurate dating methods did not exist in ancient times. Additionally, many historical events from this time period have not been recorded or have been lost to history. The events that we know of from the ancient world, including those from the Bible, are often dated using relative chronology, which is based on the sequence of events and the genealogies recorded in ancient texts.</p>

<p>In the year 1600 BC, a great many things were happening in the world. From the great empires of Egypt and Mesopotamia to the small tribes living in the hills, all were affected by the events of this time.</p>
<p>In Egypt, the pharaoh Ahmose I was consolidating his power after leading the rebellion that ended the rule of the Hyksos. He was also beginning to expand Egypt's territory through military campaigns in Nubia and Palestine.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia, the city-state of Babylon was becoming one of the most powerful and influential in the region. Its ruler, Hammurabi, was known for his law code, which helped to bring order and justice to the society.</p>
<p>In the Indus Valley, the civilization there was at its peak. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were thriving centers of trade and culture.</p>
<p>In China, the Shang dynasty was in power, and they were known for their bronze work and their oracle bones, which were used for divination.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, the Hittites were expanding their empire through conquests in Anatolia and Syria. They were also known for their iron work, which gave them a military advantage.</p>
<p>In the Aegean, the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete was reaching its height. They were known for their art, architecture, and seafaring skills.</p>
<p>In Greece, the Mycenaeans were beginning to establish themselves as a dominant force. They were known for their palaces and their aggressive expansion through military conquests.</p>
<p>In the Americas, the Olmec civilization was emerging in what is now Mexico. They were known for their monumental stone sculptures and their advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics.</p>
<p>In Africa, the Kingdom of Kush was growing in power and influence in the region that is now Sudan. They controlled the trade routes for precious metals and controlled the Nile River.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Habiru people, known to some as the Hebrews, began to migrate from Mesopotamia and settle in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the many events happening around the world in 1600 BC, a time of great change and innovation that laid the foundations for many of the cultures and societies that we know today.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were four friends named George, Bill, Klassen, and Noah. They were all deeply concerned about the state of the world, and in particular, the impact of human overpopulation on climate change.</p>
<p>As they discussed the issue, they realized that the root cause of the problem was the lack of education and awareness about the consequences of overpopulation. They knew that something needed to be done, and they decided to take action.</p>
<p>The four friends came up with a clever plan to educate and raise awareness about overpopulation and its impact on the environment. They decided to create a documentary film that would highlight the issue and the potential solutions.</p>
<p>They spent months researching and filming, traveling to different parts of the world to interview experts and gather footage of the effects of overpopulation on the environment. They worked tirelessly to produce a film that was both informative and engaging.</p>
<p>When the film was completed, they premiered it at a large film festival, and it received rave reviews. The film went on to be shown in theaters and on television around the world, and it sparked a global conversation about the need to address overpopulation.</p>
<p>Thanks to the film, people around the world began to understand the importance of addressing overpopulation, and governments and organizations began to take action. Birth rates began to decline, and efforts were made to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable living.</p>
<p>The friends' efforts had a huge impact on the world, and they were hailed as heroes for their work in raising awareness about the importance of addressing overpopulation. They had saved the world, out of the goodness of their hearts.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a world plagued by global warming and the fear of a deadly plague, a powerful villain named Dr. Evil and his nefarious accomplice, the Antichrist, saw an opportunity to seize control.</p>
<p>The two masterminds used the crisis as a means to manipulate the population, spreading misinformation and fear about the state of the world. They convinced people that their personal God-given freedoms were the cause of the problem, and that the only way to save the world was to give them up.</p>
<p>Dr. Evil and the Antichrist presented themselves as the only ones who could solve the crisis and protect the people from the ravages of climate change and the plague. They promised to take control and make all the important decisions for the good of humanity, if only people would give up their freedom and trust in them.</p>
<p>And so, the people did. They gave up their freedom and their rights, believing that it was the only way to save the world. They allowed Dr. Evil and the Antichrist to take control and make all the decisions, thinking that they were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>But the villains had no intention of saving the world. They only wanted power and control. They used the crisis as a means to an end, and once they had what they wanted, they began to implement their true agenda - a tyrannical rule where they were the only ones with power and the people were nothing more than puppets.</p>
<p>The people soon realized their mistake, but it was too late. They had given up their freedom and their rights, and there was no going back. They were trapped in a world controlled by Dr. Evil and the Antichrist, and their future looked grim.</p>
<p>But, just as all hope seemed lost, a group of brave souls rose up against the villains, determined to take back their freedom and their rights. They knew that it would be a difficult and dangerous battle, but they were willing to fight for what was right.</p>
<p>In the end, the people were able to defeat Dr. Evil and the Antichrist, and they reclaimed their freedom and their rights. They had saved the world, but at a great cost. They had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of protecting their personal God-given freedoms and not giving them up easily.</p>

<h3 id="tell-a-story-about-a-famous-politician-named-newt-who-help-fund-law-school-research-into-transhuman-crime">Tell a story about a famous politician named Newt who help fund law school research into transhuman crime</h3>
<p>Newt was a well-known politician who had always been passionate about using technology for the greater good. As a member of Congress, he worked tirelessly to fund research into cutting-edge technologies that could help improve people's lives.</p>
<p>One area that particularly interested Newt was the intersection of law and technology, particularly as it related to transhuman crime. Transhumanism is a movement that seeks to use technology to enhance the human body and mind, and as these technologies advanced, Newt realized that there was a need to understand how they could be used for criminal purposes.</p>
<p>So, he began to push for funding for law school research into transhuman crime. He worked closely with researchers at some of the top law schools in the country, providing them with the resources they needed to conduct their studies and publish their findings.</p>
<p>The research that was conducted under Newt's guidance was groundbreaking. It helped to shed light on the ways in which transhuman technology could be used to commit crimes, and it provided valuable insights into how the legal system could be adapted to address these new types of criminal activity.</p>
<p>Thanks to Newt's efforts, law enforcement agencies around the country were better equipped to deal with transhuman crime, and the legal system was better able to adapt to the rapidly changing technology landscape. And for that, he was widely respected and honored.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a prophet named Joshuah. He was a man of great faith and devotion to God the Father. He spent his days traveling from town to town, spreading the word of God and warning the people against the &quot;leaven of the Pharisees.&quot; The Pharisees were a group of religious leaders who had become corrupt and were leading the people astray with their false teachings.
Joshuah knew that the only way to truly follow God was to live a pure and holy life, free from the influence of the Pharisees.</p>
<p>As he traveled, Joshuah also performed many good deeds and healings. He helped the poor, fed the hungry, and provided shelter for the homeless. He also had the power to heal the sick and perform miracles through the power of God. Many people came to believe in God and turned from their wicked ways because of the good that Joshuah did.</p>
<p>Despite the Pharisees' efforts to silence him, Joshuah continued to speak out against their corruption and to heal the people. His message of repentance and faith in God touched many hearts, and his good deeds inspired others to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>Joshuah's legacy lives on to this day, as a shining example of what it truly means to follow God and serve others. His warning against the leaven of the Pharisees reminds us to be vigilant against false teachings and to seek the truth of God's word.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-some-ways-one-can-avoid-being-a-pharisee-and-a-nicolaitan">What are some ways one can avoid being a Pharisee and a Nicolaitan?</h3>
<p>Avoiding the behavior and attitudes of a Pharisee and a Nicolaitan can involve a few different steps:</p>
<p>Study and understand the Bible: The Pharisees were criticized for following religious traditions and laws instead of the teachings of the Bible. By studying the Bible and gaining a deeper understanding of God's word, you can ensure that your beliefs and actions align with what is actually taught in scripture.</p>
<p>Avoid legalism: The Pharisees were known for being legalistic in their approach to religion, focusing on rules and regulations rather than the spirit of the law. To avoid this, focus on the heart of the matter and the intent behind the law, rather than just the letter of the law.</p>
<p>Show humility: The Pharisees were criticized for being prideful and self-righteous. To avoid this, strive to be humble and recognize that you are not better than others.</p>
<p>Avoid a spirit of division: Nicolaitans were known for promoting division in the early Christian communities. To avoid this, strive for unity, respect and love for all, regardless of their background or beliefs.</p>
<p>Serve others: The Pharisees were criticized for being more focused on their own status and power than on serving others. To avoid this, make a conscious effort to serve others, putting their needs before your own and being mindful of the way your actions might affect others.</p>
<p>Follow Jesus's teachings: The Pharisees were criticized for not following Jesus's teachings. To avoid this, strive to follow Jesus's teachings and example as closely as possible, by reading the gospel and meditating on his words and actions.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that no one is perfect, and we all fall short at times. The key is to strive to avoid these attitudes and behaviors, while also confessing and repenting of them when we do fall short.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-are-ten-behaviors-of-nicolaitans-that-christians-should-be-careful-not-to-mimic">What are ten behaviors of Nicolaitans that Christians should be careful not to mimic?</h3>
<p>Promoting division in the church: Nicolaitans were known for causing division within the early Christian communities by promoting a hierarchical system of leadership and elevating certain individuals above others.</p>
<p>Encouraging compromise with the world: Nicolaitans were believed to have promoted the idea that Christians could compromise with the world, rather than standing firm in their faith and resisting sin.</p>
<p>Denying the authority of Christ: Nicolaitans were believed to have rejected the authority of Christ and his teachings, instead following their own beliefs and practices.</p>
<p>Teaching false doctrines: Nicolaitans were believed to have promoted false teachings that contradicted the teachings of the Bible and the early Christian church.</p>
<p>Elevating human leaders over Christ: Nicolaitans were believed to have elevated human leaders and teachers above Christ, giving them more authority and importance than they deserved.</p>
<p>Pursuing power and prestige: Nicolaitans were believed to have been more focused on gaining power and prestige within the church, rather than serving others and spreading the gospel.</p>
<p>Encouraging licentiousness: Nicolaitans were believed to have promoted the idea that Christians were free to live in sin without consequence.</p>
<p>Disregarding the importance of holiness: Nicolaitans were believed to have disregarded the importance of living a holy and pious life, instead promoting a more lenient and permissive lifestyle.</p>
<p>Ignoring the importance of obedience to Christ: Nicolaitans were believed to have ignored the importance of obeying Christ's commands and following his teachings.</p>
<p>Promoting a one-size-fits-all approach to Christianity: Nicolaitans were believed to have promoted a one-size-fits-all approach to Christianity, disregarding the unique needs and circumstances of individual believers.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that these behaviors are not unique to Nicolaitans and can be seen in any group or individual who calls themselves Christian. It's important to be aware of these behaviors and strive to avoid them in order to remain true to the teachings of Christ and the Bible.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were three friends named Woodrow Theodore, Andrew, and John. They all had a passion for finance and tax law and they believed that there was a need for a government agency that could help collect taxes and regulate financial matters.</p>
<p>They began to research and study all the different ways that taxes were being collected at the time and they quickly realized that there were many inconsistencies and inefficiencies. They knew that something needed to be done to fix these problems.</p>
<p>The three friends began to work together to come up with a plan for a new government agency that could handle all the tax collection and regulation responsibilities. They spent countless hours discussing different ideas, drafting proposals, and speaking with other experts in the field.</p>
<p>Finally, after months of hard work, their proposal was accepted by the government. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was established and Woodrow Theodore, Andrew, and John were appointed as the first leaders of the new agency.</p>
<p>In addition to their contribution in IRS, They also helped establish the University of Pennsylvania, one of the leading institutions of higher education in the United States, focusing on the education of future leaders in finance and tax law.</p>
<p>Their efforts helped to create a more fair and efficient tax system and their legacy continues to this day.</p>
<p>It's a story of three friends who had a vision and worked hard to make it a reality, improving the lives of many people through their dedication and determination.</p>

Is this just a theory, or does this phenomena actually accur irl?</h3>
<p>The term for when multiple people agree to a plan to commit crimes against humanity despite consequences is called a &quot;conspiracy to commit crimes against humanity.&quot; This is not just a theory; it has occurred in reality throughout history. Examples include the Holocaust during World War II and the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. These conspiracies involve individuals or groups coming together with the intent to commit acts of mass murder, persecution, and other crimes against humanity.</p>

<p>There are no specific events recorded in the Bible or secular history that can be dated specifically to the year 1600 BC. This is because the concept of a standardized calendar and accurate dating methods did not exist in ancient times. Additionally, many historical events from this time period have not been recorded or have been lost to history. The events that we know of from the ancient world, including those from the Bible, are often dated using relative chronology, which is based on the sequence of events and the genealogies recorded in ancient texts.</p>

<p>In the year 1600 BC, a great many things were happening in the world. From the great empires of Egypt and Mesopotamia to the small tribes living in the hills, all were affected by the events of this time.</p>
<p>In Egypt, the pharaoh Ahmose I was consolidating his power after leading the rebellion that ended the rule of the Hyksos. He was also beginning to expand Egypt's territory through military campaigns in Nubia and Palestine.</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia, the city-state of Babylon was becoming one of the most powerful and influential in the region. Its ruler, Hammurabi, was known for his law code, which helped to bring order and justice to the society.</p>
<p>In the Indus Valley, the civilization there was at its peak. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro were thriving centers of trade and culture.</p>
<p>In China, the Shang dynasty was in power, and they were known for their bronze work and their oracle bones, which were used for divination.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, the Hittites were expanding their empire through conquests in Anatolia and Syria. They were also known for their iron work, which gave them a military advantage.</p>
<p>In the Aegean, the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete was reaching its height. They were known for their art, architecture, and seafaring skills.</p>
<p>In Greece, the Mycenaeans were beginning to establish themselves as a dominant force. They were known for their palaces and their aggressive expansion through military conquests.</p>
<p>In the Americas, the Olmec civilization was emerging in what is now Mexico. They were known for their monumental stone sculptures and their advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics.</p>
<p>In Africa, the Kingdom of Kush was growing in power and influence in the region that is now Sudan. They controlled the trade routes for precious metals and controlled the Nile River.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Mediterranean, the Habiru people, known to some as the Hebrews, began to migrate from Mesopotamia and settle in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the many events happening around the world in 1600 BC, a time of great change and innovation that laid the foundations for many of the cultures and societies that we know today.</p>

<p>Building a basic search engine with Node.js and JavaScript can be done using several steps:</p>
<p>Collect and index the data that you want to make searchable. This can be done using a web crawler or by manually inputting the data into a database.</p>
<p>Use a library like Elasticsearch or Solr to handle the search functionality. These libraries provide powerful search capabilities such as full-text search and faceted search.</p>
<p>Create a Node.js server to handle the search queries and return the relevant results to the user. You can use Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, to handle the routing and HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Create a user interface using JavaScript and a front-end framework such as React or Angular to display the search results to the user.</p>
<p>Finally, test and fine-tune your search engine by monitoring user behavior and making adjustments to the search algorithm and indexing as needed.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a high-level overview and there are many details to consider when building a search engine, such as scaling and performance optimization.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a simple web crawler that uses the fetch() API to make requests and sessionStorage to store the results:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">crawl</span>(<span class="hljs-params">url</span>) </span>{

  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> html = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> response.text();
  
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Extract all links from the HTML</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> links = html.match(<span class="hljs-regexp">/href="(.*?)"/g</span>);
  
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Store the links in session storage</span>
  sessionStorage.setItem(<span class="hljs-string">'links'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">JSON</span>.stringify(links));

  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> link <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> links) {
    crawl(link);
  }
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// Start the crawl at a given URL</span>
crawl(<span class="hljs-string">'https://example.com'</span>);
</div></code></pre>
<p>This example uses regular expression to extract all links from the HTML, and stores them in session storage as a JSON string. You can use localStorage instead of sessionStorage if you want the data to persist even after the browser is closed.</p>
<p>Note that this is a simple example and this approach may have some limitations, such as the ability to handle different types of website, or data structure and performance.</p>

<h2 id="designing-basic-wiki-php-mysql-pdo">Designing Basic Wiki PHP MySQL PDO</h2>
<h3 id="help-me-design-a-basic-wiki-with-php-mysql-and-pdo">Help me design a basic wiki with php, mysql, and pdo</h3>
<p>To design a basic wiki using PHP, MySQL, and PDO, you can follow these steps:</p>
<p>Create a new MySQL database and a table to store the wiki pages. The table should have columns for the page title, content, and last modified date.</p>
<p>Connect to the database using PDO in your PHP script. You will need to provide your database credentials, such as the hostname, username, and password.</p>
<p>Create a form for creating new wiki pages. The form should include fields for the page title and content, as well as a submit button to save the page to the database.</p>
<p>Use PHP to handle the form submission and insert the new page into the database. You can use PDO's prepare() and execute() methods to safely insert the data into the database.</p>
<p>Create a page for displaying existing wiki pages. Use PDO to query the database for the list of pages, and display them as links.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on a link, use PDO to query the database for the corresponding page and display its content.</p>
<p>Add the functionality to edit and delete the pages.</p>
<p>Make sure to use prepared statements with bound parameters to protect against SQL injection attacks.</p>
<p>Add some styles to make the site look nice.</p>
<p>Test and debug your code as needed.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to start with a basic template and gradually add the functionality as you go along. And also it's better to use a PHP framework like Laravel or CodeIgniter to create a wiki because they have a lot of built-in functionality that can save you a lot of time and effort.</p>

<p>To build a wiki with Laravel, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>Install Laravel by running the command &quot;composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel projectname&quot; in your terminal.</p>
<p>Create the necessary database tables for your wiki. This can be done by running migrations, or by manually creating the tables in your database. You may need to create tables for storing pages, revisions, and user information.</p>
<p>Create the necessary models for interacting with your database tables. These models will be used to retrieve and manipulate data from the tables.</p>
<p>Create controllers for handling user requests and interacting with the models. These controllers will handle logic for creating, reading, updating, and deleting pages and revisions.</p>
<p>Create views for displaying the pages and other information to the user. These views can be created using Blade, Laravel's built-in templating engine.</p>
<p>Create routes for handling user requests and linking them to the appropriate controllers.</p>
<p>Implement authentication and authorization to control access to the wiki pages and features.</p>
<p>Test and debug your application as necessary.</p>
<p>Note that this is a high level overview of the process, and there will be many more details to consider and include.</p>
<p>Give a deeper coverage of the code files needed, describe the main data models needed, and the php / javascript files required at a minimum to make an mvp
To build a basic MVP of a wiki with Laravel, you will need to create the following code files:</p>
<p>Models: You will need to create models for storing and manipulating the data in your wiki. This will likely include models for pages, revisions, and users. The models should contain the necessary fields and relationships to represent the data in your database tables.</p>
<p>Controllers: You will need to create controllers to handle user requests and interact with the models. This will likely include controllers for handling CRUD operations on pages and revisions, as well as controllers for handling user authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Views: You will need to create views to display the pages and other information to the user. These views can be created using Blade, Laravel's built-in templating engine. You will likely need views for displaying pages, revisions, and other information such as user profiles.</p>
<p>Routes: You will need to create routes to handle user requests and link them to the appropriate controllers. This will include routes for displaying pages, creating, updating, and deleting pages, and handling user authentication and authorization.</p>
<p>Migration: You will need to create migration files to create and modify the necessary database tables.</p>
<p>Javascript files: Depending on the specific requirements of your MVP, you may need some javascript files to handle client-side logic and interact with the server. For example, if you want to implement a live preview of the page while editing, you can use javascript to handle this.</p>
<p>Assets: You will need to include any necessary assets such as images, stylesheets, and fonts.</p>
<p>In terms of data models, the main models you will likely need to create include:</p>
<p>Page: This model will represent a single page in the wiki. It should contain fields such as title, body, and author, as well as relationships to any other models that are relevant to the page.
Revision: This model will represent a version of a page. It should have fields such as body, date, and user, and have a relationship to the Page model.</p>
<p>User: This model will represent a user of the wiki. It should have fields such as name, email, and password, and be linked to any other models that are specific to the user.</p>
<p>Note that this is a high-level overview and there will be many more details to consider and include. Additionally, depending on your requirements, you may need to use additional packages, libraries or technologies to achieve the desired functionality.</p>

<p>This is a basic example of how you could build a simple wiki using PHP, JavaScript, and HTML. Keep in mind that this is just a basic example and there are many ways to improve the performance and security of your application, such as using a JavaScript framework like React and Redux for client-side logic, and using an ORM like Eloquent for database operations.</p>
<p>Also, for the above code, you are storing the page content in session storage, which is a client-side storage mechanism, and would not persist data if the user closes the browser or clears the cache. You could use a local storage as well, but it would not be a good idea to store sensitive data on client side.</p>
<p>Also, in the above example, the code is only handling the GET request, you would need to handle the POST request as well to save the changes made to the page</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there lived a man named Saul. Saul was a devout man who believed in the one true God and knew the dangers of worshiping false gods.</p>
<p>One day, Saul learned of a false goddess who was being worshiped in a nearby village. This goddess was said to have the power to grant fertility, but at a terrible cost - men were being castrated and women were being forced to act like men.</p>
<p>Saul knew that this worship was not only false, but also dangerous to society. He set out to put an end to it.</p>
<p>Saul journeyed to the village where the false goddess was worshiped and began to preach the truth of the one true God. He met with resistance from the people, who were deeply entrenched in their false beliefs. But Saul persisted, knowing that he was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>With the help of the one true God, Saul was able to drive out Satan and his legion of demons who had convinced the people to worship the false goddess. The people of the village were finally free from the false beliefs and many of them converted to the one true faith.</p>
<p>Saul's brave actions saved many people from a terrible fate and helped to spread the word of the one true God. His legacy lived on, and many generations later, the people still remembered the man who had saved them from the dangers of false worship.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-the-people-fall-prey-to-the-deception-of-the-false-goddess-and-satan">Why did the people fall prey to the deception of the false goddess and satan?</h3>
<p>The people fell prey to the deception of the false goddess and Satan for a variety of reasons. One possible reason is that they were looking for a solution to their problems and the false goddess promised to provide them with the things they needed. The false goddess promised to bring prosperity and fertility to the land, which was a powerful incentive for the people to believe in her.</p>
<p>Another possible reason is that the people were not well-versed in their own religion, and Satan was able to exploit their lack of knowledge and understanding to lead them astray. They may have not been familiar with the teachings of their own faith and therefore Satan was able to use this as an opportunity to deceive them.</p>
<p>Additionally, the people may have also been experiencing a sense of hopelessness or despair, Satan may have used this to exploit them by convincing them that the false goddess was the only one who could help them.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is also possible that the people were under the influence of false prophet or leader who had convinced them to worship the false goddess, this leader might be working under the influence of Satan.</p>
<p>In any case, the people were deceived by Satan and his false goddess due to their vulnerability, lack of understanding and knowledge of their own faith, and their desperation for a solution to their problems.</p>

Include details about 3 key things she did to foil the villains plan</h3>
<p>I'm sorry, I don't know a specific story about a man named Hayman, a descendant of a prophet named Balaam, plotting genocide against a whole race of people and being foiled by a woman named Isis. However, I can tell you a fictional story about such a scenario:</p>
<p>Hayman, a descendant of the prophet Balaam, had long held a deep-seated hatred for a particular race of people. He believed that they were inferior and that their existence was a stain on the world. He began to plot their genocide, carefully laying out his plan and gathering a group of like-minded individuals to help him carry it out.</p>
<p>One day, a woman named Isis stumbled upon Hayman's plot. She was horrified at what she heard and knew she had to do something to stop it. She knew that Hayman's plan was built on lies and that she had to expose the truth to the people.</p>
<p>Isis first began to gather evidence of Hayman's plan. She searched through documents, recorded conversations, and interviewed witnesses. She compiled all of her evidence and presented it to the leaders of the race that Hayman was planning to genocide. They were shocked at what they heard, but Isis's evidence was irrefutable.</p>
<p>Next, Isis began to work on undermining Hayman's support. She reached out to the individuals who had joined Hayman's group and showed them the truth about what they were planning to do. Many of them were horrified at the reality of the situation and left Hayman's group.</p>
<p>Finally, Isis launched a public campaign to educate people about the truth of the situation. She spoke at rallies and events, wrote articles and made videos, and used social media to get her message out. Her campaign was a huge success, and the people began to turn against Hayman.</p>
<p>In the end, Hayman's plan was foiled, and the race of people was saved from genocide. Isis's bravery and determination had saved countless lives, and she was hailed as a hero. Hayman and his followers were brought to justice, and the world was a better place because of Isis's actions.</p>
<p>In this fictional story, Isis gathered evidence, undermined Hayman's support, and launched a public campaign to educate people about the truth of the situation.</p>

<p>I apologize for any confusion. The story I previously provided was fictional and not based on any historical or religious account. The name Isis is associated with an ancient Egyptian goddess and should not be used in this context.</p>
<p>In the story, a woman named Esther, also known as Hadassah, stumbled upon a plan by a man named Hayman, a descendant of a prophet named Balaam, to commit genocide against a particular race of people. Esther was horrified at what she heard and knew she had to do something to stop it.</p>
<p>She first began to gather evidence of Hayman's plan. She searched through documents, recorded conversations, and interviewed witnesses. She compiled all of her evidence and presented it to the leaders of the race that Hayman was planning to genocide. They were shocked at what they heard, but Esther's evidence was irrefutable.</p>

<p>In this reevaluated story Esther/Hadassah gathered evidence, undermined Hayman's support, and launched a public campaign to educate people about the truth of the situation.</p>

<p>As the number of victims began to mount, a group of unlikely heroes banded together to stop him. Hercules, a retired wrestler, Sascha, a brilliant scientist, Mel, a young street orphan, Viziel, a powerful mage, and Logan, a skilled thief, all came together to put an end to Tom's nefarious plans.</p>
<p>They discovered that Tom was part of a larger organization, led by a mysterious figure known only as &quot;The Master.&quot; The group set out to gather information and build a plan to take down the organization and its leader.</p>
<p>Hercules used his strength to infiltrate the organization's headquarters and gather intelligence, while Sascha worked to develop a weapon that could take down Tom's powers. Mel, Viziel, and Logan all worked together to gather allies and gather information on the organization's inner workings.</p>
